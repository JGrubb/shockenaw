    <p>
      John Skehan is a classically trained piano player that took up the mandolin shortly before Railroad Earth got together in 2000.  His mando style often reflects this pianistic, textural style and he's known to spend way too much time in the bathrooms of hotels practicing Bach and shit.  This is the primary reason for the premature graying of many of his bandmates' hair.

    <p>
      Andy grew up as one of the youngest of something like 42 kids and was drafted into one of his older brother's bands when he was 4 years old.  He's known as "the right brain of Railroad Earth", and is close personal friends with numerous TSA agents the world over.  He gets back to his bluegrass roots in the Shockenaw Mountina Boys with the guitar, mando, and banjo.

    <p>
      Tim Carbone is a Yankee fan, this much is true.  What many people don't realize is that he is actually very loquacious in his love for all things Bronx Bombers.

    <p>
      Johnny Grubb is a renaissance man - a father of 3 beautiful boys, husband to a beautiful wife, world famous bluegrass musician, computer programmer, and all around really great guy to be around at all times.  His wife will attest to this.  He is also the author of this website, and of all these band bios, and clearly misses his former RRE bandmates quite a lot.
